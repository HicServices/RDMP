### Fixed 

- Fixed ExceptionViewer showing the wrong stack trace under certain circumstances
- Fixed cache usage bug where sql parameters were used in queries (cache would not be used when it should)

- You can now add new datasets to an extraction configuration directly from the "Core" folder in Execute Extraction window (rather than having to go back to the DataExport tree view)

- Fixed bug where adding/moving cohort sets between containers ([INTERSECT]/[UNION]/[EXCEPT]) could result in 2 objects with the same Order in the same container (resulting in ambiguous order of execution).
- Fixed UI bug where selecting an extractable [Catalogue] would hide its extractable (small green e) icon overlay
- Fixed bug where deleting a Pinned object would not unpin the object
- Fixed bug where database tables with brackets in the name could break synchronization (these tables are now ignored by RDMP and cannot be imported).

- Fixed bug with low resolution monitors and collections where leading columns could shrink to be no longer visible
- Adding new filters/containers (AND/OR) now correctly expand and highlight the created object in collections

- Fixed bug caching patient index tables (cohort creation) when there are multiple tables being joined in the query.
- Fixed error when logging very large (over 4000 characters) to the RDMP logging database

### Removed

- Extraction destination property CleanExtractionFolderBeforeExtraction now defaults to false (i.e. do not delete the contents of the extraction directory before extracting)
- Extraction destination property CleanExtractionFolderBeforeExtraction is now implemented in the Checks phase of the component lifecycle rather than on receipt of first batch of records (this prevents accidentally deleting files produced by upstream components)
- 
### Fixed

- Fixed obscure bug in plugins implementing the `ICustomUI` interface when returning a new object in `GetFinalStateOfUnderlyingObject` that resulted in the UI showing a stale version of the object
- Connecting to a non existent server in ServerDatabaseTableSelector now shows the Exception in the RAG icon (previously just showed empty database list)
 
- Fixed bug where adding/removing a column in Aggregate Editor would would reset the Name/Description if there were unsaved changes (to Name/Description)

- Improved Find (Ctrl+F) dialog layout and added shortcut codes (e.g. typing "c Bob" will return all Catalogues containing the word "Bob")
- Message boxes now display a limit of 20,000 characters (full text can still be accessed by the copy to clipboard button).
- DLE Debug options (e.g. Skip migrating RAW=>STAGING) now appear as a drop down with more descriptive titles (e.g. StopAfterRAW)
 
### Fixed 

- Fixed bug when cloning a Pipeline called "Bob" when there was already an existing Pipeline called "Bob (Clone)"
- Fixed validation issue in some user interfaces of INamed classes (e.g. Catalogue) where all properties were checked for illegal characters instead of just the Name
- Fixed image scaling in Metadata reports to 100% (previously 133%)
- Governance report now properly escapes newlines and quotes in [Catalogue] descriptions when outputting as CSV
- Fixed bug in Plugin code generator for tables with a Name property (previously incorrect C# code was generated)
- Fixed bug in SQL query editor user interface when the query returned a table that included binary columns with large amounts of data in
- Clicking a collection button or using GoTo/Show now correctly pops the relevant collection if it is set to auto dock (pinned).
- Application title bar now correctly updates after loading a tab (previously it was left with the caption "Loading...")
- Un Pinning in a collection using X now correctly maintains tree selection (consistent with the context menu Tree=>UnPin)
- Fixed display order of cohort sets in Cohort Query Builder to correctly match the compiler (previously the tree view order was misleading)

## [3.0.16-rc] - 2019-07-08

### Added 

- Forward/backward navigation in LogViewer now preserves text filters / TOP X
- Added the ability to create example datasets and configurations/projects etc during installation / startup
- Objects with names containing problematic characters (e.g. \ ") are highlighted red
- New right click context menu GoTo shows related objects e.g. which ExtractionConfiguration(s) a [Catalogue] has been used in
- Heatmap hover tool tip now shows more information about the cell value
- 'Other Pipelines' (unknown use case) can now be edited by double clicking.  This prompts user to pick a use case to edit them under
- Creating a Catalogue/TableInfo by importing a file now lets you rename the table after it has been created
- Added new DLE module ExecuteSqlFileRuntimeTask which runs the SQL stored in the RDMP platform database (rather than relying on an sql file on disk like ExecuteSqlFileRuntimeTask)
- RDMP platform database schemas no longer require 100% matching to models.  This allows limited backwards compatibility between minor versions of RDMP in which new fields are added to the database.

### Changed

- Updated to latest version of [BadMedicine] (0.0.1.2)
- Updated to latest version of [FAnsiSql] (0.9.2)
- File=>New now launches modal dialog instead of dropdown menu
- [Project] objects can now be sorted (previously they always appeared alphabetically)
- [Project] creation UI now shows duplicate ProjectNumbers as a Warning instead of an Error allowing users to create 2+ Projects with shared cohorts
- Disabled objects in tree views now appear greyed out instead of red
- Improved message shown when cohorts with null descriptions are preventing cohort importing
- Attempting to deleting an Extractable [Catalogue] no longer shows an error and instead asks if you want to make it non extractable (then delete)
- xmldoc are now shipped inside SourceCodeForSelfAwareness.zip (instead of side by side with the binary).  This avoids an issue where [Squirrel drops xmldoc files](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/issues/1323)

### Fixed 

- Fixed bug in CLI (rdmp.exe) where yaml settings would override command line values for connection strings to platform databases
- Disabled smiley controls now render in greyscale
- Fixed bug in Aggregate graphs which included a PIVOT on columns containing values with leading whitespace
- Fixed crash bug in UI responsible for picking the DLE load folder that could occur when when xmldocs are missing
- Fixed bug resolving Plugin dll dependencies where dependencies would only be resolved correctly the first time they were loaded into the AppDomain
- Fixed Culture (e.g. en-us) not being passed correctly in DelimitedFlatFileAttacher
- Fixed bug where Updater would show older versions of RDMP as installable 'updates'
