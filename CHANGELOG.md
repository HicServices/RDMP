- Added menu for inspecting the state of a cohort compiler (view SQL executed, build log, results etc)

### Fixed 

- Fixed ExceptionViewer showing the wrong stack trace under certain circumstances
- Fixed cache usage bug where sql parameters were used in queries (cache would not be used when it should)

## [3.2.1-rc1] - 2019-10-14

### Added

- Long running processes that previously blocked the UI (e.g. create primary key) now have a small dialog describing task and allowing cancellation.
- Proposed Fix dialog now has standard look and feel of RDMP message boxes (including keywords etc)
- Double clicking an executing task in Cohort Builder now shows cohort build log as well as Exception (if any)

- You can now add new datasets to an extraction configuration directly from the "Core" folder in Execute Extraction window (rather than having to go back to the DataExport tree view)
- MDFAttacher now checks for existing mdf/ldf files in the RAW server data directory.  Existing files will trigger a warning.  After the warning an attempt is still made to overwrite the file(s) (as occured previously)
- Tab key now also works for autocomplete in SQL editor windows (previously only Enter worked)
- Orphan cohort sets (do not belong to any Cohort Identification Configuration) now appear under a top level folder in 'Cohort Builder' collection

- Deleting an object now clears the selection in tree views (previously selection would become an arbitrary object).
- Fixed bug where adding/moving cohort sets between containers ([INTERSECT]/[UNION]/[EXCEPT]) could result in 2 objects with the same Order in the same container (resulting in ambiguous order of execution).
- Fixed UI bug where selecting an extractable [Catalogue] would hide it's extractable (small green e) icon overlay
- Fixed bug where deleting a Pinned object would not unpin the object
- Fixed bug where database tables with brackets in the name could break synchronization (these tables are now ignored by RDMP and cannot be imported).

- Fixed bug where searching for "Pipeline" or "Pipe" did not show all pipelines
- Fixed bug caching patient index tables (cohort creation) when there are multiple tables being joined in the query.
- Fixed error when logging very large (over 4000 characters) to the RDMP logging database

### Removed
- Cohort sets no longer appear under Catalogues (Find / GoTo now open the parent cohort identification configuration)

- Extraction destination property CleanExtractionFolderBeforeExtraction now defaults to false (i.e. do not delete the contents of the extraction directory before extracting)
- Extraction destination property CleanExtractionFolderBeforeExtraction is now implemented in the Checks phase of the component lifecycle rather than on reciept of first batch of records (this prevents accidentally deleting files produced by upstream components)
- 
### Fixed

- Connecting to a non existant server in ServerDatabaseTableSelector now shows the Exception in the RAG icon (previously just showed empty database list)
 
- Fixed bug where adding/removing a column in Aggregate Editor would would reset the Name/Description if there were unsaved changes (to Name/Description)

- Added the ability to create example datasets and configurations/projects etc during installation / startup
- Objects with names containing problematic characters (e.g. \ ") are highlighted red
- New right click context menu GoTo shows related objects e.g. which ExtractionConfiguration(s) a [Catalogue] has been used in
- Heatmap hover tool tip now shows more information about the cell value
- 'Other Pipelines' (unknown use case) can now be edited by double clicking.  This prompts user to pick a use case to edit them under
- Creating a Catalogue/TableInfo by importing a file now lets you rename the table after it has been created
- Added new DLE module ExecuteSqlFileRuntimeTask which runs the SQL stored in the RDMP platform database (rather than relying on an sql file on disk like ExecuteSqlFileRuntimeTask)
- RDMP platform database schemas no longer require 100% matching to models.  This allows limited backwards compatibility between minor versions of RDMP in which new fields are added to the database.

### Changed

- Updated to latest version of [BadMedicine] (0.0.1.2)
- Updated to latest version of [FAnsiSql] (0.9.2)
- File=>New now launches modal dialog instead of dropdown menu
- [Project] objects can now be sorted (previously they always appeared alphabetically)
- [Project] creation UI now shows duplicate ProjectNumbers as a Warning instead of an Error allowing users to create 2+ Projects with shared cohorts
- Disabled objects in tree views now appear greyed out instead of red
- Improved message shown when cohorts with null descriptions are preventing cohort importing
- Attempting to deleting an Extractable [Catalogue] no longer shows an error and instead asks if you want to make it non extractable (then delete)
- xmldoc are now shipped inside SourceCodeForSelfAwareness.zip (instead of side by side with the binary).  This avoids an issue where [Squirrel drops xmldoc files](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/issues/1323)

### Fixed 

- Fixed bug in CLI (rdmp.exe) where yaml settings would override command line values for connection strings to platform databases
- Disabled smiley controls now render in greyscale
- Fixed bug in Aggregate graphs which included a PIVOT on columns containing values with leading whitespace
- Fixed crash bug in UI responsible for picking the DLE load folder that could occur when when xmldocs are missing
- Fixed bug resolving Plugin dll dependencies where dependencies would only be resolved correctly the first time they were loaded into the AppDomain
- Fixed Culture (e.g. en-us) not being passed correctly in DelimitedFlatFileAttacher
- Fixed bug where Updater would show older versions of RDMP as installable 'updates'
