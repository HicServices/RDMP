## Commands
The [Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) 'Command' is implemented in RDMP.  Most functionality in RDMP is undertaken by a command and new features should be implemented as new commands if possible. 
All commands implement `IAtomicCommand` - it's a good place to start when diagnosing issues.

- If you want to see which command is running when an issue manifests in the windows UI you can use the menu item 'Diagnostics->Last Command Monitor'
- Commands have access to `IBasicActivateItems` which contains modal operations for illiciting user feedback.  Bear in mind that some implementations do not support interactive content so always check `IBasicActivateItems.IsInteractive`
- UI implementations are
  - `IActivateItems`: windows gui client
  - `ConsoleInputManager`: [CLI client](./Documentation/CodeTutorials/RdmpCommandLine.md).  May be [running in a script](./Documentation/CodeTutorials/RdmpCommandLine.md#scripting)
  - `ConsoleGuiActivator`: TUI user interface (cross platform - great for SSH/headless servers)
  - `TestActivateItems`: Implementation that can be used in UI tests

## Objects 

RDMP objects inherit from `DatabaseEntity`.  There are multiple types of `IRepository` e.g [YamlRepository], [CatalogueRepository].  
When there is a database backed object store (e.g. [CatalogueRepository], [DataExportRepository], [DQERepository]) then it is important
to load/save/create with the correct one.  For example you cannot save an `Project` to [CatalogueRepository], only [DataExportRepository].
If you want to see what repository type it is meant to be then look at the constructor e.g. `public Project(IDataExportRepository repository, string name)`

- In the GUI client if you are ever wondering what an object type is you can right click it and choose 'What is this?'
- All objects have a unique ID.  The uniqueness is restricted to the `IRepository` it is in.


## Windows Forms Designer
------------------------------------
- Using the Windows Forms Designer requires renaming SelectedDialog`1.resx to
  SelectedDialog.resx first.  Otherwise you get this bug:
  https://github.com/HicServices/RDMP/issues/1360
- If creating a new Control or Form you should consider inheriting from
  `RDMPSingleDatabaseObjectControl<T>` or `RDMPUserControl`.  If you do
  this make sure to declare an appropriate `TypeDescriptionProvider`
  (see below).  Otherwise it will not open in Designer.

```csharp
[TypeDescriptionProvider(typeof(AbstractControlDescriptionProvider<LoggingTab_Design, UserControl>))]
public abstract class LoggingTab_Design : RDMPSingleDatabaseObjectControl<YourSingleObjType>
{

}
```

## Icons and ResX

In 2001 Microsoft announced the [deprecation of System.Drawing.Common](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/234).  The suggested migration path was to move to alternative libraries e.g. [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp).

RDMP followed this approach.  The update was merged in [#1355](https://github.com/HicServices/RDMP/pull/1355).  This means that all resx files must store `Byte[]` and code must be manually updated if images are added using the designer.

The approach for adding new icons is:

- Open resx file in designer (e.g. CatalogueIcons.resx)
- Drop new image into designer and save

This creates a new entry in .resx file for example:

```xml
<data name="YourImage" type="System.Resources.ResXFileRef, System.Windows.Forms">
    <value>..\YourImage.png;System.Drawing.Bitmap, System.Drawing, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a</value>
  </data>
```

This must be updated to be a raw `Byte[]`.  Change the `value` tag by replacing everything after the file path (first semicolon) with `;System.Byte[], mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089</value>`

For example 
```
<data name="YourImage" type="System.Resources.ResXFileRef, System.Windows.Forms">
    <value>..\YourImage.png;System.Byte[], mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089</value>
  </data>
```

Next update the `.Designer.cs` file (e.g. `CatalogueIcons.Designer.cs`).  Add a new entry for the new resx file:

```csharp
/// <summary>
///   Looks up a localized resource of type Image.
/// </summary>
public static Byte[] YourImage
{
    get
    {
        object obj = ResourceManager.GetObject("YourImage", resourceCulture);
        return ((Byte[])(obj));
    }
}
```

This `Byte[]` can then be turned into either a Windows Forms compatible Bitmap (windows only):

```csharp
 CatalogueIcons.YourImage.ImageToBitmap();
```

Or a cross platform ImageSharp `Image` with:

```csharp
Image.Load<Rgba32>(CatalogueIcons.YourImage);
```

## Release Process
RDMP releases are performed by GitHub Actions CI server.  The logic for this is in [build.yml](./.github/workflows/build.yml).

To perform a release merge all branches into `develop` then perform the following:

- Update [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)
  - Add a header with the version number and date e.g. `## [7.0.21] - 2022-09-26`
  - Add a diff link at the bottom e.g. `[7.0.21]: https://github.com/HicServices/RDMP/compare/v7.0.20...v7.0.21`
- Update [SharedAssemblyInfo](./SharedAssemblyInfo.cs)
  - Update all 3 versions to your new number e.g. `7.0.21`
- Commit and push

When picking a new version number you should strongly consider only bumping the minor version (i.e. the third number).  Changes to Major or Minor version number will result in incompatible plugins (until a version of the plugin is released with a bumped dependency) - for more information on this see [Plugin Writing](./Documentation/CodeTutorials/PluginWriting.md).

Next tag the release with `git` as the new version number.  Do not forget the `v` prefix e.g.

```
git tag v7.0.21
git push --tags
```

This should push a new release to both `NuGet` and `GitHub Releases`.  If you have a problem with the build CI, you can [delete the local AND remote tag](https://devconnected.com/how-to-delete-local-and-remote-tags-on-git/) then fix the problem then re-tag.

Once the release is built and you have tested the binary in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HicServices/RDMP/releases) you can make it live by updating [rdmp-client.xml](./rdmp-client.xml)

- Update the `version` tag
- Update the `url` tag to the new version
- Update the `changelog` tag to have the new version anchor hyperlink

Test that your RDMP client can update with `Help->Check for updates` (note that if your xml file change is on `develop` you will need to specify this as the update path)

Finally merge `develop` into `main` and push.  This will ensure that the `main` branch always has the source of the last RDMP version release.

## Database Schema Changes
Avoid making changes to the RDMP schema until you are experienced with the codebase as these changes have the greatest possibility of breaking deployments/plugins.

If you need to record new information about an object consider using [ExtendedProperty] instead of writting a patch (especially if you are working within a Plugin).

Do not write patches for the [CohortCachingDatabase](.\Rdmp.Core\Databases\QueryCachingPatcher.cs), [LoggingDatabase](.\Rdmp.Core\Databases\LoggingDatabasePatcher.cs) or [DataQualityEngine](.\Rdmp.Core\Databases\DataQualityEnginePatcher.cs) databases.   These 3 databases are cross [DBMS] (you can create them in MySql / PostgresSQL and/or Oracle).  Patching for cross [DBMS] database schemas is not implemented yet.  If you
want to look into writing such a patch you would start with the `SortedDictionary<string, Patch> GetAllPatchesInAssembly(DiscoveredDatabase db)` method and adjust the patch SQL generated for each [DBMS].

If after considering all the alternatives you are sure that a new patch is required and it is for the [Catalogue or Data Export Databases](.\Rdmp.Core\Databases\PlatformDatabase.cs) then the process is as follows:

- Within Visual Studio copy and paste the latest patch in the up folder (e.g. [./Rdmp.Core/Databases/CatalogueDatabase/up/076_AddFolders.sql](./Rdmp.Core/Databases/CatalogueDatabase/up/))
- Rename the file with a higher number and description (e.g. 077BreakRDMP.sql)
- Update the contents of the script
  - Script must start with a Version number although if the schema change is backwards compatible it is acceptable to leave this unchanged
  - Scripts must be designed to run multiple times without fail (i.e. use `if not exists` to check before adding a column)
  - Scripts must be backwards compatible where possible (e.g. add new fields but do not delete existing ones)
  - If your new column is required (i.e. not null) then you must UPDATE existing values and provid a database default so that older versions of RDMP that are still running do not crash on object creation.

Once the script is written then the next time you run RDMP you will be prompted to apply the new patch.
