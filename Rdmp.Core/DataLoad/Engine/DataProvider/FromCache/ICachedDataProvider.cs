/// MEF discoverable plugin implementation of IDataProvider intended to read from the ILoadProgress cache directory (e.g. and unzip into
/// LoadDirectory.ForLoading) during data loading.  This is only required if you want to be able to change the way you interact with
/// your cache (e.g. if you have a proprietary archive format).  In general you should try to ensure any caches you create are compatible with
/// BasicCacheDataProvider and just use that instead.
