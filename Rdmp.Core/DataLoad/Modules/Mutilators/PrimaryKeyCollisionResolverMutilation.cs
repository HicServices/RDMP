/// <summary>
/// Data load component which can delete records in an (unconstrained) RAW table to enforce uniqueness of the primary key field (as it is configured in LIVE).
/// This lets you resolve non-exact duplication based on column order (e.g. if there is a collision where one has an later 'DataAge' field then use the later
/// one and discard the earlier one.
/// 
///  <para>This is a very dangerous operation which uses the primary key collision resolution order (Accessible through CatalogueManager by right clicking a
/// TableInfo and choosing 'Configure Primary Key Collision Resolution') to delete records in a preferred order, fully eliminating primary key collisions.  
/// It is a very good idea to not have this task until you are absolutely certain that your primary key is correct and that the duplicate records being deleted
/// are the correct decisions e.g. delete an older record in a given load batch and not simply erasing vast swathes of data!.  The Data Load Engine will tell 
/// you with a warning when records are deleted and how many.  If you notice a lot of deletion then try removing this component and manually inspecting the data 
/// in the RAW database after the data load fails (due to unresolved primary key conflicts)</para>
/// 
/// <para>This component requires that a collision resolution order has been configured on the TableInfo (See ConfigurePrimaryKeyCollisionResolution)</para>
