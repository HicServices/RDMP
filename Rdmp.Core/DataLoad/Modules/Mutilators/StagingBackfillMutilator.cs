/// UPDATE of the values for that record to the new values in STAGING that are being loaded).

/// <para>This component is designed to support loading periods of old data into a LIVE data table that has moved on (i.e. to backfill a dataset) without 
/// overwritting newer versions of a record (with primary key x) with old.  For example it is 2011 and you have found a year of data you forgot to load back
/// in 2009 but you expect that since 2009 there have been historical record updates for records originally generated in 2009 (you want to load all 2009 records
/// from the historical batch except where there has been an update since).</para>
/// 
/// <para>This is done by selecting a 'TimePeriodicity' field that identifies the 'dataset time' of the record (as opposed to the load time) e.g. 'date blood sample
///  taken'.  STAGING records will be deleted where there are records in LIVE wich  have the same primary key but a newer TimePeriodicity date.</para>
