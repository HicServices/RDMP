/// While actual patient identifiers are stored in an external database (referenced by a ExternalCohortTable), RDMP still needs to have a reference to each cohort for extaction.
/// The ExtractableCohort object is a record that documents the location and ID of a cohort in your ExternalCohortTable.  This record means that the RDMP can record which cohorts
/// are part of which ExtractionConfiguration in a Project without ever having to move the identifiers into the RDMP application database.
/// 
/// <para>The most important field in ExtractableCohort is the OriginID, this field represents the id of the cohort in the CohortDefinition table of the ExternalCohortTable.  Effectively
/// this number is the id of the cohort in your cohort database while the ID property of the ExtractableCohort (as opposed to OriginID) is the RDMP ID assigned to the cohort.  This
/// allows you to have two different cohort sources both of which have a cohort id 10 but the RDMP software is able to tell the difference.  In addition it allows for the unfortunate
/// situation in which you delete a cohort in your cohort database and leave the ExtractableCohort orphaned - under such circumstances you will at least still have your RDMP configuration
/// and know the location of the original cohort even if it doesn't exist anymore. </para>
