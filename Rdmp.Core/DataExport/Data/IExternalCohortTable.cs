/// Since every agency handles cohort management differently the RDMP is built to supports diverse cohort source schemas.  Unlike the logging, dqe, catalogue databases etc there
/// is no fixed managed schema for cohort databases.  Instead you simply have to tell the software where to find your patient identifiers in an ExternalCohortTable record.  This
/// stores:
/// 
/// <para>What table contains your cohort identifiers;
/// Which column is the private identifier;
/// Which column is the release identifier.</para>
/// 
/// <para>In addition to this you must have a table which describes your cohorts which must have columns called id, projectNumber, description, version and dtCreated.</para>
/// 
/// <para>Both the cohort and custom table names table must have a foreign key into the definition table.  </para>
/// 
/// <para>You are free to add additional columns to these tables or even base them on views of other existing tables in your database.  You can have multiple ExternalCohortTable sources
/// in your database for example if you need to support different identifier datatypes / formats.</para>
/// 
/// <para><see cref="Rdmp.Core.CohortCommitting.CreateNewCohortDatabaseWizard"/> to automatically generate a database that is compatible with the format requirements and has
/// release identifiers assigned automatically either as autonums or GUIDs (I suggest using GUIDs to prevent accidental crosstalk from ever occuring if you handle magic numbers from
/// other agencies). </para>
