/// <para>2. 'Cohort Aggregate' - Produce a list of unique patient identifiers from a dataset (e.g. 'all patients with HBA1c test code > 50 in biochemistry')</para>
/// <para>3. 'Joinable PatientIndex Table' - Produce a patient identifier fact table for joining to other Cohort Aggregates during cohort building (See JoinableCohortAggregateConfiguration)</para>
/// <para>The above labels are informal terms.  Use IsCohortIdentificationAggregate and IsJoinablePatientIndexTable to determine what type a given
/// AggregateConfiguration is. </para>
