## Execute Full Extraction To Database MSSQL
This data extraction pipleine component allows you to extract data into a known database.
You can add the database you want to extract to as an external database within RDMP.

This component has several configurable options that are detailed below
| Configuration Option                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Target Database Server                          | External server to create the extraction into, a new database will be created for the [Project]: ../CodeTutorials/Glossary.md#Project based on the naming pattern provided                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Database Naming Pattern                         | How do you want to name datasets, use the following tokens if you need them:             $p - [Project](../CodeTutorials/Glossary.md#Project) Name ('e.g. My [Project](../CodeTutorials/Glossary.md#Project)')          $n - [Project](../CodeTutorials/Glossary.md#Project) Number (e.g. 234)          $t - Master Ticket (e.g. 'LINK-1234')          $r - Request Ticket (e.g. 'LINK-1234')          $l - Release Ticket (e.g. 'LINK-1234')  Default : Proj_$n_$l                                   |
| Table Naming Pattern                            | How do you want to name datasets, use the following tokens if you need them:             $p - [Project](../CodeTutorials/Glossary.md#Project) Name ('e.g. My [Project](../CodeTutorials/Glossary.md#Project)')          $n - [Project](../CodeTutorials/Glossary.md#Project) Number (e.g. 234)          $c - Configuration Name (e.g. 'Cases')          $d - Dataset name (e.g. 'Prescribing')          $a - Dataset acronym (e.g. 'Presc')            You must have either $a or $d  Default : $c_$d |
| Drop Table If Load Fails                        | If the extraction fails half way through AND the destination table was created during the extraction then the table will be dropped from the destination rather than being left in a half loaded state                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Alter Timeout                                   | Timeout to perform all ALTER TABLE operations (column resize and PK creation)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Copy Collations                                 | True to copy the column collations from the source database when creating the destination database.  Only works if both the source and destination have the same DatabaseType.  Excludes columns which feature a transform as part of extraction.                                                                                                                             |
| Always Drop ExtractionTables                    | True to always drop the destination database table(s) from the destination if they already existed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Make Final Table Distinct When Batching Resules | True to apply a distincting operation to the final table when using an [ExtractionProgress](../CodeTutorials/Glossary.md#ExtractionProgress).  This prevents data duplication from failed batch resumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Append Data If Table Exists                     | If this extraction has already been run, it will append the extraction data into the database. There is no duplication protection with this functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Include Timestamp                               | If checked, a column names 'extraction_timestamp' will be included in the extraction that denotes the time the record was added to the extraction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Use Acronym For File Naming                     | Naming of flat files is usually based on [Catalogue](../CodeTutorials/Glossary.md#Catalogue).Name, if this is true then the [Catalogue](../CodeTutorials/Glossary.md#Catalogue).Acronym will be used instead                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Date Format                                     | The date format to output all datetime fields in e.g. dd/MM/yyyy for uk format yyyy-MM-dd for something more machine processable, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8kb3ddd4(v=vs.110).aspx                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Clean Extraction Folder Before Extraction       | If this is true, the dataset/globals extraction folder will be wiped clean before extracting the dataset. Useful if you suspect there are spurious files in the folder                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Extraction Subdirectory Pattern                 | Overrides the extraction sub directory of datasets as they are extracted          $c - Configuration Name (e.g. 'Cases')          $i - Configuration ID (e.g. 459)          $d - Dataset name (e.g. 'Prescribing')          $a - Dataset acronym (e.g. 'Presc')          $n - Dataset ID (e.g. 459)  e.g. /$i/$a                                                              |
