# Background
Both 'drag and drop' and 'double click' tie directly to the 'Command' pattern RDMP uses for [Context Menus](./CreatingANewRightClickMenu.md) and [Command Line](./RdmpCommandLine.md).

Drag and drop and double clicking (called activation) is a core part of the RDMP API and is handled through the class `RDMPCommandExecutionProposal<T>` on a `Type` basis.  Each object that supports activation and/or drop must have an associated instance of `RDMPCommandExecutionProposal<T>` called `ProposeExecutionWhenTargetIs<SomeClass>`.  

This derrived class will decide what tab/window/custom action to show when `Activate` happens either as part of double click or as part of `ExecuteCommandActivate` (e.g. from a right click menu) or a call to `BasicUICommandExecution.Activate` and decide what `ICommandExecution` is executed when a given object/collection is dropped on it.

_Example of dragging a [Catalogue] onto an ExtractionConfiguration_

This pattern allows all tree views system wide to have consistent behaviour for a given object type (via `RDMPCollectionCommonFunctionality`).  

For the developer it allows easy troubleshooting, if there is a problem with a tree object right click it and select 'What is this?' then search for the class `ProposeExecutionWhenTargetIs<ClassName>`.  Since the return type of the drop method `ProposeExecution` is `ICommandExecution` you simply have to decide what the appropriate command is for the drop operation.

See [ProposeExecutionWhenTargetIsExtractionConfiguration](./../../Rdmp.UI/CommandExecution/Proposals/ProposeExecutionWhenTargetIsExtractionConfiguration.cs) for an example of how consise the code is.

# Activation
To add support for activating (double clicking) an object we must first know its `Type`.  Right click it in the tree view and select 'What is this?' to determine its `Type`.

![ExampleMenu](Images/DoubleClickAndDragDrop/WhatIsThis.png)

Create a new class called `ProposeExecutionWhenTargetIs<TypeName>` in namespace `CatalogueManager.CommandExecution.Proposals` and inherit from `RDMPCommandExecutionProposal<T>`.  Return true for `CanActivate` and put a test message in `Activate`.

```csharp
public class ProposeExecutionWhenTargetIsPipeline:RDMPCommandExecutionProposal<Pipeline>
{
    public ProposeExecutionWhenTargetIsPipeline(IActivateItems itemActivator) : base(itemActivator)
    {
    }

    public override bool CanActivate(Pipeline target)
    {
        return true;
    }

    public override void Activate(Pipeline target)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Double clicked");
    }

    public override ICommandExecution ProposeExecution(ICombineToMakeCommand cmd, Pipeline target, InsertOption insertOption = InsertOption.Default)
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```

Check this works in the application by double clicking a tree node of the appropriate `Type` or right clicking and selecting `Edit`.

# Tab Documents
Most tabs in RDMP are designed for editing/executing a single `Type` of object held in one of the RDMP platform database tables (e.g. Catalogue, CatalogueItem, [Project] etc).  By convention these controls should be named `<MyClass>UI` unless there is a good reason not to.  These user interfaces all inherit from abstract base class `RDMPSingleDatabaseObjectControl<T>`.  There can be multiple tabs for a given `Type` e.g. [CacheProgress] has both `CacheProgressUI` (for changing cache dates etc) and `ExecuteCacheProgressUI` (for executing the cache).

To show a new tab control for editing your object you should create a normal WinForms control as you normally would but inherit from `RDMPSingleDatabaseObjectControl<T>` instead of `UserControl`.

To trigger the user interface on `Activate` of an `RDMPCommandExecutionProposal<T>` call `ItemActivator.Activate` 

<!--- d5ff7bebc57942df8c6c57a316bf72c6 --->
```csharp
public override void Activate(AggregateConfiguration target)
{
    ItemActivator.Activate<AggregateEditorUI, AggregateConfiguration>(target);
}
```

If you find you cannot use Visual Studio Designer to edit your control because of the abstract/generic base class `RDMPSingleDatabaseObjectControl` [you can create an AbstractControlDescriptionProvider with an intermediate class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1620847/how-can-i-get-visual-studio-2008-windows-forms-designer-to-render-a-form-that-im).

<!--- 56df0867990f4b0397e51a6a49f7bdd0 --->
```csharp
[TypeDescriptionProvider(typeof(AbstractControlDescriptionProvider<ANOTableUI_Design, UserControl>))]
public abstract class ANOTableUI_Design : RDMPSingleDatabaseObjectControl<ANOTable>
{
}
```

# Drop
To add support for item dropping you should add an implementation to the body of the `ProposeExecution` method.  The method provides the following parameters.

| Parameter | Purpose |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ICombineToMakeCommand cmd| Self contained class describing both the object being dragged and salient facts about it e.g. if  it is a `CatalogueCombineable` then it will know whether the dragged [Catalogue] has at least one patient identifier column.|
| T target | The object the cursor is currently hovering over |
| InsertOption insertOption | Whether the cursor is above or below or on top of your object (if the collection the object is in supports it) |

The reason we have an `ICombineToMakeCommand` is so we can front load discovery and encapsulate facts into a single class which can then be waved around the place to look for valid combinations.  If an object doesn't have an associated `ICommand` then it won't be draggable in the first place.

To add support for dropping an object with an existing `ICombineToMakeCommand` you should cast `cmd` and return an appropriate `ICommandExecution`.

<!--- 59f55fa3ef50404291c7ae3996772635 --->
```csharp
public override ICommandExecution ProposeExecution(ICombineToMakeCommand cmd, Pipeline target, InsertOption insertOption = InsertOption.Default)
{
	if(cmd is CatalogueCombineable sourceCatalogueCombineable)
		return new ExecuteCommandDelete(ItemActivator,sourceCatalogueCombineable.Catalogue);

	return null;
}
```

While not terribly useful, you can now drop a [Catalogue] on `Pipeline` to delete the [Catalogue]

![ExampleMenu](Images/DoubleClickAndDragDrop/DropDelete.png)

You can create your own `ICommandExecution` implementations by [following this tutorial](./CreatingANewRightClickMenu.md#creating-a-new-command)

# Drag

`RDMPCombineableFactory` is responsible for creating `ICombineToMakeCommand` objects at the start of a drag operation (including files etc from the OS).  Most objects will have a 1 to 1 mapping with an `ICombineToMakeCommand` e.g `CatalogueCombineable` is a wrapper for a [Catalogue].  The `ICombineToMakeCommand` is responsible for doing expensive fact gathering at the start of a drag operation.

If you need to provide drag support for a new object `Type` (e.g. [Pipeline]) first create an appropriate `ICombineToMakeCommand` e.g. `PipelineCombineable` and then in `RDMPCombineableFactory` modify the method `ICommand Create(object modelObject)` to return it given the appropriate modelObject:

```csharp
public ICombineToMakeCommand Create(object modelObject)
{
	//Other stuff
	
	var pipeline = modelObject as Pipeline;
	if (pipeline != null)
		return new PipelineCombineable(pipeline);
	
	//Other stuff
}
```

The `ICombineToMakeCommand` could look like this.

<!--- bbee6cb18ebd4e35a19f5fa521063648 --->
```csharp
public class PipelineCombineable : ICombineToMakeCommand
{
    public Pipeline Pipeline { get; private set; }
    public bool IsEmpty { get; private set; }

    public PipelineCombineable(Pipeline pipeline)
    {
        Pipeline = pipeline;
        IsEmpty = Pipeline.PipelineComponents.Count == 0;
    }

    public string GetSqlString()
    {
        return "";
    }
}
```

Doing this will allow you to drag the object (when previously you couldn't).  This helps avoid the user dragging something he will never be able to drop on anything.

![CannotDrop](Images/DoubleClickAndDragDrop/CannotDrop.png)

To provide drop targets for the new `ICombineToMakeCommand` go to the `RDMPCommandExecutionProposal<T>` of the object `Type` you want to be able to drop on and [provide an implementation of ProposeExecution](#drop)
