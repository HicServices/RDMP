License Note

This license is based on the open source zlib/libpng license. The idea was to keep the license as simple as possible to encourage use of NUnit in free and commercial applications and libraries, but to keep the source code together and to give credit to the NUnit contributors for their efforts. While this license allows shipping NUnit in source and binary form, if shipping a NUnit variant is the sole purpose of your product, please let us know.
