/// <summary>
///     Lets you configure a column in a dataset as discarded during the load process (either completely - Oblivion or
///     stored in an identifiers only area - StoreInIdentifiersDump).
///     <para>
///         BACKGROUND:
///         PreLoadDiscardedColumn(s) are an alternative (to ANOTables) way of anonymising dataset columns.  A well
///         implemented anonymisation protocol will include both ANOTable substitutions
///         and PreLoadDiscardedColumns.  A PreLoadDiscardedColumn is a column containing identifiable which is NOT
///         REQUIRED by anyone to use the dataset.  For example if you have a demography
///         dataset with a PatientIdentifier, Forename and Surname then you can safely configure Forename and Surname as
///         discarded columns because you have the unique patient identifier (which
///         should have an ANOTable transform on it btw) to distinguish between patients when doing linkage.
///     </para>
///     <para>There are 3 types of PreLoadDiscardedColumn, each is treated differently at data load time:</para>
///     <para>
///         DiscardedColumnDestination:
///         Oblivion - This column DOES NOT exist in the live data table but is created in the RAW load bubble so that the
///         data can be loaded from supplied files.  The data is then deleted prior
///         to the migration to STAGING
///         StoreInIdentifiersDump - This column DOES NOT exist in the live data table but is created in the RAW load
///         bubble, instead of being migrated to STAGING the data is stored in an 'identifiers
///         only' area (the Identifier Dump) along with the PrimaryKeys of the data, this allows you to use the identifiers
///         in debugging or to change your mind about anonymisation later on and reintroduce
///         the discarded data back into your live database.
///         Dilute - This column DOES exist in the live data table but is diluted during load e.g. date of birth 2001-05-03
///         might be diluted to the first of the month (I know, its insane right but hey
///         governance wants it!).
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The theory is that data analysts do not need to know patient level identifiable data to do their jobs and
///         researchers certainly don't.  This is all entirely optional and if you
///         do not want to anonymise your data repository then don't worry about this window.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Before using the form, make sure you have configured at least one IdentifierDump server.  This can be done
///         through ManageExternalServers.  Select the Identifier Dump Server.
///         Next create some PreLoadDiscardedColumn(s) that correspond to supplied fields you do not want to go through to
///         your live database during data load.  Each column must have a
///         name and SqlDataType that matches what you are trying to load.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         If you already have a data table and you want to drop some of the columns from it then you can paste in a list
///         of column names and any that match known columns will automatically
///         get created as the appropriate datatype/name.  After doing that you will have to manually drop the columns
///         yourself on your server though.
