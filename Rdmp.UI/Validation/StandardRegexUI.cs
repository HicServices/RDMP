/// <summary>
/// Regular expressions are a great way of validating the content of your datasets.  For example you could have a regex pattern ^[MFU]$ which would force a cells contents to be either
/// M, F or U with nothing else allowed.  Rather than having each data analyst type the same regular expression into the validation rules of each column you can create a StandardRegex.
/// This StandardRegex will then be available as a validation rule for any column (See <see cref="ValidationSetupUI"/>).
/// 
/// <para>Because regular expressions can get pretty complicated both a concept name and a verbose description that explains what the pattern matches and what it won't match.  You can also 
/// test your implementation by typing values into the 'Testing Box' and clicking Test.  For example if you typed in 'Male' with the above pattern it would fail validation because it
/// is not either an M or a F or a U.  If your pattern was [MFU] then it would pass because it contains an M! </para>
