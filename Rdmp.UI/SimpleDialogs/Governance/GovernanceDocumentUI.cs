/// The RDMP is designed to store sensitive clinical datasets and make them available in research ready (anonymous) form.  This usually requires governance approval from the data
/// provider.  It is important to store the document trail and schedule (e.g. do you require yearly re-approval) for audit purposes.  The RDMP does this through Governance Periods
/// (See GovernancePeriodUI).  
/// 
/// <para>This control allows you to configure/view attachments of a GovernancePeriod (e.g. an email, a scan of a signed approval letter etc). For ease of reference you should describe
/// what is in the document (e.g. 'letter to Fife healthboard (Mary Sue) listing the datasets we host and requesting re-approval for 2016.  Letter is signed by Dr Governancer.)'</para>
