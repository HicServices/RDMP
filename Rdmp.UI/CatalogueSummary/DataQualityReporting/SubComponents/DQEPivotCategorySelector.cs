/// column is a single categorical field in the dataset that is the most useful way of slicing the dataset e.g. Healthboard.  If your dataset has a pivot column
/// then this control will let you change which results are displayed in any IDataQualityReportingCharts from either All rows in the dataset or only 
/// those where the pivot column has a specific value.  If your pivot column contains nulls then these records will only be audited under the ALL category.
